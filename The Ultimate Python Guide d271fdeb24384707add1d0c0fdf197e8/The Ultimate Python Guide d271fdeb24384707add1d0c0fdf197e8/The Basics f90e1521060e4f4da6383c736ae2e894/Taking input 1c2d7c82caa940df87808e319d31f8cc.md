# Taking input

If you want to create a python software that changes according to your needs, you need input! In Python, input is incredibly simple to use, and is super flexible, allowing you to use it in nearly every situation.

```python
var1 = input()
print(var1)
```

The first line of that snippet states that that the variable “var1” is what “input()” returns!

( This return system will be explained in further detail later on in this book )

To make our input more beautiful, we can add a prompt before our code asks for input!

Like this for example:

```python
var1 = input('Enter here')
```

It’ll print “Enter here” and then ask for input, to make the input more noticeable for user friendliness!
